When it comes to making career decisions in the software field to maximize your earnings, get close to the revenue. While this aphorism is well known in banking, I have seen few people discuss it in relation to enterprise software businesses. I have worked at enterprise software companies for six years and at this point I have seen myself how proximity to revenue is the primary driver of compensation and the best way to convince a company to value you. I have lived the various stages, from pre-revenue to private equity acquisitions. At every stage of the enterprise software company life cycle, Sales is the department to be in. People in the sales have the most direct and causal link to revenue and thus the most direct link to their income.

Highest compensation is not the only benefit -- expense accounts and a travel budget are a poweful perks. I enjoy business travel when it's no more than twice in a five week period.
